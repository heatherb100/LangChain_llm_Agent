* This app generates text and images using OpenAI's APIs
  
  - Text outputs are generated by calling functions from OpenAI with
    the model "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4"

  - Temperature can be set by the user

  - Voice recognition and Text-To-Speech (TTS) are implemented by using
    functions from OpenAI

  - Recording of the user's voice is stopped when there is no input for 3 seconds
  
  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for an external document is implemented
    by using langchain functions.
